# Build-Tsugaru-on-Windows

This batch script will automatically download the latest version of [Tsugaru, the FM Towns emulator by Soji Yamakawa](https://github.com/captainys/TOWNSEMU), and build it. I wrote this to get the latest changes without having to wait for an official release. Keep in mind that official releases are much more refined, this will give you the bleeding-edge changes, could contain bugs or other weird things that might change later.

(with that in mind, make sure you update your software every once in a while!!)

The build process takes ~5-10 minutes depending on your computer's processor speed, probably RAM, etc.

If you don't already have [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), you should download those.


## Instructions

Download CMake, Git, Visual Studio if you didn't already do that, see the above links.

Download the batch file and put it in your user folder, so "C:\Users\xxxx" with the x's representing your username.

Double-click, or run from the command line. Relax for a few minutes.

Breathe slowly. Sip some water. Ahh. How nice and peaceful it is in this room. Oh! It's done.

How helpful! The file shows you where the GUI/CUI are, but doesn't copy them just in case you need to screw around with the files or whatever.

If you're just running the emulator (which is what most people will do), just copy the files from their separate locations to a folder, and be done with it. That's it!! Wow!
